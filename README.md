# Basic App Base

Ready-for-use base application made in Fuse. Includes off-the-canvas/under-the-canvas side navigation.

Also includes `postinstall` script in `package.json`, which runs `nfuse`. This will install any packages listed in `dependencies` for use with your Fuse project (requires Node.js).

## Requirements

 * Fuse 0.30 or later

## Configuration

### Style

Basic style assets are defined in UX files listed under the `Style/` directory.

 * `Colors.ux` lists a number of global defaults that are used as the application theme colors.
 * `Metrics.ux` contains common dimensions and element sizes that are used throughout the app.
 * `Fonts.ux` defines any fonts that are used.

## TODO:

 * JS code testing
